## 🧮 Billing Formula

The application uses the following calculation:

### Subtotal

```text
Subtotal = Item Price × Quantity
```

for every ordered item.

### Discount

```text
Discount Amount = Subtotal × Discount Rate / 100
```

### Taxable Amount

```text
Taxable Amount = Subtotal - Discount
```

### GST

```text
GST = Taxable Amount × 5 / 100
```

### Grand Total

```text
Grand Total = Taxable Amount + GST
```
